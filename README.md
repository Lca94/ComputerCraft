# Poeks's ComputerCraft Programs!

Turtles for the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft. Some use the mod MiscPeripherals. The instructions below assume you are using the Direwolf20 pack on Feed the Beast. 

## Installation

First go to `/Applications/FTB/Direwolf20/minecraft/mods` and extract computercraft.zip. After the folder is created, delete the .zip file (or move it somewhere else).

Then clone the repo: 
`git clone git@github.com:poeks/ComputerCraft.git /Applications/FTB/Direwolf20/minecraft/mods/computercraft/lua/rom/poeks`

Programs should now be available on a computer in-game in `rom/poeks`
